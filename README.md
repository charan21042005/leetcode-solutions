## 📌 About This Repository

Welcome to **`leetcode-solutions`** 👋  

This repository is a **daily problem-solving journal** where I consistently solve **LeetCode problems** with a strong focus on:

- 🧠 **Core DSA concepts**
- 💡 **Multiple approaches & intuition**
- ⚙️ **Clean, interview-ready code**
- 📈 **Consistency through daily streaks**

Rather than just storing solutions, this repo documents **how to think**, **why an approach works**, and **what patterns to learn** from each problem.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Build strong **problem-solving fundamentals**
- Improve **logical thinking & coding clarity**
- Prepare effectively for **technical interviews**
- Maintain a **daily coding streak**
- Create a **well-documented DSA knowledge base**

## 🗓️ Daily Streak Philosophy

📅 **One day = One problem**

For each daily problem:
- A **separate folder** is created
- Includes the **problem solved on that date**
- Covers:
  - Problem understanding
  - Intuition & ideas
  - Brute-force to optimal approaches
  - Edge cases
  - Time & space complexity
  - Clean implementations

This ensures **deep learning over shallow solving**.

---

## 🧠 What You’ll Find in Each Problem Folder

✔ Problem summary  
✔ Key concepts involved  
✔ Step-by-step intuition  
✔ Multiple approaches (if applicable)  
✔ Dry runs & edge cases  
✔ Optimized solutions  
✔ Interview tips  

---

## 🛠️ Languages Used

- **C++** – STL-based, efficient, competitive programming style  
- **Java** – Clean OOP-based, interview-focused style  

Each solution is written to be:
- Easy to understand
- Easy to revise
- Safe from unnecessary shortcuts

---

## 📈 Progress Tracking

- 🔥 Daily problems added consistently
- 🟢 Repository updated regularly
- 📊 Focus on quality over quantity

---

## 🤝 Contribution & Usage
