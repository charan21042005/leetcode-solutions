# 🔥 Daily LeetCode Streak – Problem Log

Welcome to the **Daily-Streak** section of my LeetCode journey 🚀  

This folder tracks my **day-by-day LeetCode problem solving**, where I solve **one problem per day** with:
- Deep explanations
- Clean, human-readable code
- Multiple languages (C++, Java, Python)
- Interview-focused logic

The goal is **consistency + clarity**, not just solving problems.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Folder

- Maintain a **daily problem-solving streak**
- Build strong **DSA fundamentals**
- Document **intuition, approaches, and optimizations**
- Create a **revision-ready & recruiter-friendly** record
- Show **discipline and long-term consistency**

---

## 🧠 What Each Day Contains

Each **Day-XX** folder includes:
- `README.md` → In-depth explanation (intuition, approaches, dry run, complexity)
- `Solution.cpp` → C++ (optimal + commented learning approaches)
- `Solution.java` → Java (same logic, interview-ready)
- `Solution.py` → Python (clean & beginner-friendly)

> From **Day-04 onwards**, the **optimal approach is active**,  
> and **other approaches are commented** for learning.
